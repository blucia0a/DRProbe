DRProbe
=======

This software is a library for accessing the debug registers (watchpoints and
breakpoints) on intel x86-64 computers, without the need to use ptrace.  

This is free software, and is licensed under the GPL, version 3.  A version of
this license was included with this software in a file named LICENSE.  If this
file was not included with this software, it is available on [The GNU Website](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt/ "GNU.org").


Overview
--------
There are two parts to this software:

1. The debug_mod kernel module
2. The drprobe userspace library

The debug_mod kernel module provides an interface to the debug registers via
the /proc filesystem.

The drprobe userspace library provides a C-level interface to the registers,
abstracting the low-level accesses to /proc.


Building
--------
There are two steps to building this software: building the kernel module, and building the user-space library.  

First, be sure you've installed the kernel headers for your kernel.  
Next, run "make" in the debug_mod directory.  This will build the kernel module.  
Finally, run "make" in the top level directory.  This will build the user-space library.  


Using DRProbe
-------------
*To load the kernel module, run "insmod debug_mod.ko" in the debug_mod subdirectory.  You need root privilege to load a kernel module.

*To use the library, include drprobe.h in your project.  drprobe.h lists the api functions available.   Link your project with libdrprobe.so, and you should be all set.
